## Covid Report
The total number of cases in the United States is`r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

**Answer to Note**: To add commas to the *total number of US deaths* you need to use the function PrettyNum() when returning the total_deaths in the get_total_deaths function. 

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
